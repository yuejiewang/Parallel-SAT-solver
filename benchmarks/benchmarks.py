for each of those, varying the number of threads (1-64), time all the test cases and take an average

benchmark.py expected behavior:
 1. take list of executables as commandline input
 2. run each executable on each input in benchmarks/inputs
    - time each run and keep it in a file called benchmark_<executable>.txt in the format:
        inputname   ms runtime






take command line input for executables
