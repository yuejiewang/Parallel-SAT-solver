"""plingeling
lingeling
DPLL sequential
DPLL parallel

for each of those, varying the number of threads (1-64), time all the test cases and take an average


- tests work with all the seq files
- have sequential DPLL use utils if it works
- convert DPLL to while loop and change how "check for empty clause" thing works - have it use a data structure
- benchmarks script (lorenzo to send plingeeling and lingeling instructions and sample cnf files to test with)"""
